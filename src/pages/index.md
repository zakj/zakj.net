# Whiskey<br>ginger &<br>a dash of<br>bitters.

Hello! I'm Zak, a design-minded engineer in Oakland, CA. I currently work at
[Propel][], where we build modern, respectful technology that helps low-income
Americans improve their financial health. I have been building/breaking things
on the web since the mid-90s, previously with companies like [Grammarly][],
[Mixpanel][], and [Etsy][].

I have various interests, including but not limited to: [motorcycling][moto],
[yoga][], [hammock camping][camping], text editors, significant whitespace,
making lists, [grammar][], and sitting quietly.

Find me on [GitHub][], [LinkedIn][], or [via email][email].

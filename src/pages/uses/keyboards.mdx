# Keyboards

TODO Here is some intro text that will appear before the keyboard diagram. Maybe some
real world photos of the keyboard and general thoughts.

If you are just looking for a good standard keyboard recommendation and don't
want to go down the rabbit hole of custom layout design, I highly recommend the
[Keychron K7][]. It's affordable, high-quality, and programmable. Otherwise,
read on!

## Philosophy

1. All keys are at most one key distant from the home row.
1. Where possible, minimize differences from a familiar row-staggered `qwerty`
layout. There will of course be a learning curve with fewer keys and the
addition of layers, but I've got decades of muscle memory that it would be nice
to build on.
1. Maintain the ability to do common keyboard shortcuts with a single hand, to
reduce movements between mouse and keyboard.

## Base layer

The "base" layer is the default: how the keyboard reacts when no other layers
are activated. It should look pretty similar to a normal layout, with the
exceptions of missing function-key and number rows, repurposing of `caps lock`,
and the six thumb keys.

</section>

<section data-active="base 37 40">

My thumbs rest on the center key of each thumb cluster, with `shift` on the left
thumb and `space` on the right. I have a habit of pressing `space` with my right
thumb exclusively, so this reduced my learning curve. Having `shift` under a thumb
means less pinky stretching, and never having to switch from one pinky-shift to
the other to reach across the keyboard.

I never use `caps lock`, but occasionally it's useful to write a word or two
in all caps. Double-tapping the thumb `shift` key activates ZMK's "caps word"
behavior, which causes the keyboard to act as if `shift` is continually held
until a "stop key" (whitespace or punctuation) is pressed.

</section>

<section data-active="base 12">

I have been using [Hammerspoon][] for years to replace the nearly-useless `caps
lock` key with a combination of `control` and `escape`. When held, the key acts
as the `control` modifier. When tapped/pressed, it emits `escape`. Very handy
to have these keys more accessible, particularly in modal editors. Here we
replicate that behavior in firmware.

<section data-active="base 12 24 35 36 37 41">

I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts on the Mac, so it was important to me to have
easy access (and, where possible, easy one-handed access) to modifiers. We've
talked about `control`, but `command` and `option` also get dedicated thumb
keys, and I keep redundant `shift` keys in the usual-ish positions in the bottom
corners since otherwise `command+shift` combinations can be awkward.

Some folks swear by "home row modifiers," where keys on the home row are dual
purposed similarly to my `control`/`escape` key, but I found this to interfere
with fast typing.

</section>

<section data-active="base 12 24 35 36 37 41" data-combos>

I'll talk a bit more about layers later, but because not every key appears on
the base layer (e.g., numbers, symbols, arrows, etc.) it would be tricky to
use those keys in `command`-based keyboard shortcuts. I've added something a
little bit like home row mods: home row mod combos. That is, pressing `d` and
`f` together (within ~20ms) acts as `command`; `s` and `d` act as `option`,
and all three keys at once works as `command+option`. This is mirrored on the
right hand.

Because some tools (looking at you, Figma) cause the mouse to behave differently
when the `space` bar is held, I also needed a way to hold `space` with my
left hand. I use a thumb+pinky combo on the two left-hand `shift` keys for
this, which is surprisingly easy to do intentionally and impossible to do
unintentionally.

</section>

<section data-active="num">
## Number/symbol layer

Almost every layout for a keyboard of this size has a number and/or symbol
layer—this one is mine. While the left thumb's inner-most key is held, this
layer is active instead of the base layer. In line with the rest of the
layout, I went for a mixture of familiarity and expediency. The thumb keys are
"transparent": they work just the same as on the base layer, and the outer pinky
columns are mostly similar with two exceptions.

</section>

<section data-active="num 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10">

Obviously numbers are pressed with their usual fingers, just one row lower than
usual. I at first experimented with numpad-style numbers (all numbers on one
hand), which is somewhat popular in the small-keyboard community, but I found
this uncomfortable in practice.

</section>

<section data-active="num 26 27 28 29 30 31 32">

Less-frequently-used symbols are also pressed with their usual fingers, but one
row *below* the home row, and there's no need to hold shift—they're available
directly on this layer.

</section>

<section data-active="num 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22">

The homerow gets symbols that are more common for text and/or programming:
dash, underscore, and all the various brackets. I've also duplicated `:` on this
layer, which makes for very comfortable neighboring-finger "rolls" for ascii
smiley/frowny faces and things like python's `def (...):`.

</section>

<section data-active="num 13 23 25 33 34">

The remaining symbols fit in positions that made some sense to me. `!` is on
the same position as `.` on the base layer. `\` corresponds to `/` on the base
layer. `=` and `+` are near each other, with `=` on the home row because it's so
common in programming.

</section>

## Function/navigation layer

<section data-active="fn">

The third layer is accessed via the right thumb's inner key, and is generally
reserved for "special" keys (that is, keys that perform some action vs emitting
a character). The right hand has arrow keys in a vi-like orientation, which
allows for easy one-handed operation. It's nice to have access to `home`, `page
up`/`down`, and `end` occasionally. I also have single-key shortcuts for tab
navigation (`command+shift+]` or `[`), since those are somewhat frequently used
and a bit awkward to hit.

This layer also has keys for screen brightness, volume, and media navigation.
Backspace on this layer is replaced with (forward) `delete`, and `escape` gets
its own key for the few applications that require holding it down.

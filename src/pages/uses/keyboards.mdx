# Keyboards

Here is some intro text that will appear before the keyboard diagram. Maybe some
real world photos of the keyboard and general thoughts.


<KeyboardScroller client:idle>
Here is some content that will be **markdown enabled**!

But need to handle margins on paragraphs, since the Text layout only looks for top-level.

<scroll-member attr="base">
the first scroll member, base
</scroll-member>

<scroll-member attr="base 16 19">
the second scroll member
</scroll-member>


</KeyboardScroller>

<some-scroll-container>

<scroll-member attr="key name or names">
</scroll-member>

</some-scroll-container>
